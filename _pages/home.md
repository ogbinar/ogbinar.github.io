Hi, I’m **Myk**! I’m passionate about data, AI, and building communities. As a corporate professional and PhD student, I enjoy exploring AI and sharing knowledge.

This site is where I share my projects, ideas, and learning journey. I believe in lifelong learning, collaboration, and the impact of data.

When I’m not working or studying, I play read books or games, and spend a lot of time with family. Connect with me on LinkedIn and say hi!
