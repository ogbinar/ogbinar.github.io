Hi, I'm **Myk**! I'm passionate about data, AI, and building communities. As a corporate data professional, PhD student, and community leader, I explore cutting-edge AI techniques and love sharing knowledge with others.  

This website is a place to share my projects, ideas, and things I'm learning about technology, data, and beyond. I believe in lifelong learning, open collaboration, and the power of data to make an impact.

When I'm not working or studying, you'll find me mentoring others, contributing to open-source projects, or spending time with my family.
